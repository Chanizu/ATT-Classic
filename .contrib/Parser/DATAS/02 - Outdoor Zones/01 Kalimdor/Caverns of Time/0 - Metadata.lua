The caverns act as a crossroads for the various timeways, and through them one can travel back and forth along the ebb and flow of time.\n\nThe Caverns of Time are home to Nozdormu and the bronze dragonflight. It is their sacred mission, one which was charged to them by the titans, to guard the caverns against the intrusion of mortals, whose interference would assuredly disrupt the flow of time.",
