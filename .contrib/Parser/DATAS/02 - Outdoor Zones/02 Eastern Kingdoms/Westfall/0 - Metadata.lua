After the bulk of the Stormwind army were scattered abroad, the Defias gang made its move by taking over several areas in Elwynn, a few farms in Westfall, and the deep, twisting caves of the Deadmines. The Stormwind army abandoned Westfall as new threats occured, such as the wild Harvest Golems that patrol the farms, the rabid Coyotes and Fleshrippers that have turned hostile, the strange Dust Devils that have begun swirling around different areas, and Gnolls that have set up camps around the area.\n\nThe people of Westfall had no choice but to make their own army: The People's Militia. Lead by Gryan Stoutmantle, the Militia is battling for their lives day after day.",
